---

`BDScrollBar` is a "Classic macOS" inspired UI component, which can be added to `UIScrollView` instances. Why? Because! That's why!
It is as performant as possible, but serves no real purpose other than to be as unfashionable as possible. Have fun!

* It also includes a modern style so it has a LITTLE BIT more usefulness.

# Features

* Finely scroll the entire content.
* Hooks into `UIScrollView` via KVO and the Obj-C Runtime.
* Animates like the standard scroll indicators - including bounce!
  * Turn off the bounce for added vintage effect!
* Tap the scroll bar track to jump down the content.
* Supports the "Taptic" feedback engine.

# Usage

`BDScrollBar` adds itself directly to the scroll view. It will not appear above or below. ðŸ™Œ

```swift

// Make
let scrollBar = BDScrollBar()

// Add
tableView.bd_addScrollBar(scrollBar)

// Adjust right edge
tableView.separatorInset = scrollBar.adjustedSeparatorInsets(for: self.tableView.separatorInset)
```

The separator insets and the layout margins of the table view can be adjusted so nothing underlaps the scroll bar.

# Installation & Compatibility

`BDScrollBar` will work with iOS 15 and above. It supports Swift **only**.

## Manual (aka Tried & True)

Download the repo and add it into your Xcode project.

## CocoaPods

```

# Why? WHY?

No reason. Have fun!
